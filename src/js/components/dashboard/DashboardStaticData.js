What is a healthy balance between recreational, residential and commercial land use?   How does an active railroad and a future subway station affect neighbourhood traffic patterns?   The Canadian Forces Supply Depot was built to withstand a bomb! How does one begin to repurpose a building like that? \n\nSo, like it or not, after 20 years, Downsview Park is still a park-in-the-making. Yet there is much that is exciting and dramatic in this development: scenic walkways, exotic fauna, excellent bird watching and a spectacular \"lake\"; numerous business startups; state-of-the-art athletic centres of excellence, film studios + circus training facility; greenhouses and a wildlife habitat centre; outdoor performance venue and the most recently announced partnership with Centennial College for an aerospace campus.

Jane Jacobs worked with then-Mayor Barbara Hall to establish these \u201cReinvestment Areas\u201d.\u00a0They were dubbed \u201cThe Two Kings\u201d \u2013 King and Parliament; and King and Spadina. The Two Kings are a unique Toronto success story.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<p>In the case of King-Spadina the area took on new life \u2013 almost immediately. Formerly vacant warehouses and factory buildings were filled with new uses within just a couple of years after the new zoning was implemented and the area has never looked back. Now, a decade later, there is enormous real estate pressure from condominium developers (often aided and abetted by the OMB) who are keen to maximize real estate values which requires the demolition of the historic fabric of the neighbourhood. Will the area be killed by its own success, or will the planners and politicians make sure that the vision that created this lively and vibrant neighbourhood \u2013 so essential to the City\u2019s economy - is protected?<\/p>\r\n<p>On this walk we will, in part, explore one of Jacobs\u2019 precepts in Death and Life of Great American Cities \u2013 that \u201cnew ideas must use old buildings\u201d. Inside the historic buildings of this neighbourhood (and others like it) \u2013 the new ideas, that will fuel our city\u2019s economy long into the future, are percolating. These types of spaces (\u201ca good lot of plain, ordinary, low-value old buildings, including some rundown old buildings\u201d)* are essential and precious to any vibrant urban economy.<\/p>\r\n<p>This walk will commence at the Roastery \u2013 the caf\u00e9 at the entrance to 401 Richmond. 401 was definitely inspired by Jane\u2019s thinking. We will do a quick tour of parts of the building (taking in the 10 foot square portrait of her created by artists John Scott and Deborah Waddington and roof garden \u2013 which Jane loved and wrote about in the New York Times magazine). We will then proceed through the streets of King Spadina and discuss the history of the zoning changes that occurred in \u201997 and the impact it had on the area, the buildings and people.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u00a0*Death and Life of Great American Cities - Jane Jacobs; Random House; 1961.

A hundred years ago, immigrants from Italy, China and eastern Europe poured into a congested, impoverished cluster of working class homes once known as MacAuleytown, and widely described as a \"slum.\"&nbsp;They ran small businesses and laboured in the Eaton's factories. Many were desperately poor, and had tough lives. At the same time, the Ward was a lively, diverse and complicated neighbourhood that looked, sounded&nbsp;functioned very differently than anglo Toronto. Consequently, it drew the attention of missionaries, social reformers, speculators and civic officials. What happened there changed Toronto and the rest of Canada. Today, scarcely any of the built form&nbsp;remains, as much of the Ward was bulldozed to make way for a new City Hall, hospitals, hotels and office buildings.

These were formed after the last glacial period (10,000 - 14,000 years ago), when ice to the north melted &amp; flowed on its way to the Humber Bay. Another key factor would be the calibre &amp; strength of our leaders; aboriginal, military &amp; administrative. Like most of Ontario in the period prior to the 1830s, prominent families dominated society through their ownership of all the land. These squires of horse and hound (in our local case, the Denisons) had a special relationship with Upper Canada's first governor John Graves Simcoe. As they migrated west, their large \"farm houses\" became seats of power. The first phase of our development in the area was the leasing of small plots of land that fed the early city. By the 1870s, as part of the survey and subdivision of their estates, commercial development began to take shape along Dundas west of Ossington,. The stories of the life along Ontario's oldest highway, a surviving glacial beachhead, was the route west long used by our first nations peoples. Its evolution into the vibrant commercial strip we have today will be the primary focus of this walk.<\/p>","accessibleInfo":null,"accessibleTransit":"Take the 501 Queen streetcar from east or west, get off at Ossington.

In the early twentieth century, the radials \u2014 electric trams that ran along Kingston Road \u2014 brought pleasure seekers out to Scarborough's scenic cliffs for a day in the country.","style":"meeting","lat":43.711634317,"lng":-79.248772258},{"title":"Stop 2 - The Refreshment Room","description":"The Refreshment Room was a welcome stopping place for day-trippers and travellers on a longer journey.

Now the Shipping Channel is the closest point that Lake Ontario comes to it's old shore line (the&nbsp;extent of the historic wetlands then known as Ashbridges Bay Marsh - which began just south of Eastern Avenue).&nbsp; <\/p><p>Paul Young - Landscape Architect, Urban Planner and Health Promoter at South Riverdale Community Health Centre - will guide walkers 1 km south from Queen Street East to the Great Lake represented by the Shipping Channel.

","longDescription":"<p>For many Torontonians, the Danforth is the main street of Riverdale or a place to eat Greek. But that image covers just a small strip of this storied street, formerly known as the Second Concession, the Danforth Plank Road and The King's Highway No. 5.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<p>Danforth east of Pape, often referred to as the \"Other Danforth,\" wasn't really developed until the 1920s, after the First World War ended and the Bloor viaduct opened. The Other Danforth has always tended to be blue collar and gritty. And while it has seen hard times, especially in the past four decades, the area is almost certainly on the leading edge of a wave of gentrification, investment and development.<\/p>\r\n<p>How do we as a community maximize the chances that we get the type of change we want? What factors are key to making neighbourhood economies thrive? How do we ensure that our sidewalks become more welcoming and pleasant and useful?<\/p>\r\n<p>A good starting point would be to read (or reread) the first three Jane Jacobs books -- especially the first: The Death and Life of Great American Cities. A good second step would be to join us for the\u00a0eighth annual Upper Midway Jane's Walk, as we try to understand how and why this stretch of the Danforth developed as it did, what made it a thriving pedestrian-friendly place for so long, and why it slipped into decline. The idea is to identify factors and lessons from the past to foster discussion and to help serve as guides for the future. Along the way, we hope to show you a lot of good reasons to get into the habit of putting your feet and your eyes on the street.<\/p>\r\n<p>Midway was largely a default name for the area between the City of Toronto (whose eastern boundary was at the Ashbridge's Creek, just east of Greenwood) and the Town of East Toronto (whose western boundary crossed Danforth about a half kilometre east of Woodbine). In its entirety, Midway, which was annexed by the city in 1909, ran down almost to Queen. This walk will focus on Upper Midway, which was north of the Grand Trunk Railway tracks, as well as the former Church of England Glebe lands north of Danforth.<\/p>\r\n<p>We're going to concentrate on the history and character of the three main Upper Midway intersections (Woodbine, Coxwell and Greenwood), as well as the three lost creeks that crossed this stretch of the Danforth -- creeks that still affect the way land is used.<\/p>","accessibleInfo":"Bring your tablet or smartphone to check out the historical pictures at worldwidewickens.com while we walk and talk.

As part of&nbsp;100-in-1 Day,&nbsp;the first Walkable Planets scale solar system was&nbsp;installed along a linear route between Christie Pits Park and Trinity Bellwoods Park. Various media outlets profiled the project, including&nbsp;Torontoist,&nbsp;BlogTO, The Grid,&nbsp;Global News,&nbsp;Metro Toronto&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Toronto Star. <\/p><p>In Fall 2014 the City Transportation department asked that the signs be taken down (boo!) because they did not conform to city signage rules. After discussions with various city staff, the signs were reinstalled (yay!) along a similar route, this time in parks rather than street-side. <\/p><p>On this page you can check out the new&nbsp;self-guided Walkable Planets tour. Starting at Christie Pits playground and heading south through a series of parks along the old Garrison Creek, a series of planetary wayfinding signs will help you get a sense of the scale of the planets and the enormous distances between them. This walk includes ten signs placed at their approximate distances from each other, at a scale of 1-to-2 billion. Take in the nine planets of our solar system, from the Sun to Pluto, on&nbsp;a lovely&nbsp;two kilometre stroll.<\/p><p>And we\u2019re not done yet. We have big plans to bring scale solar systems to different neighbourhoods in the city.<\/p><p>Are you a teacher interested in using the wayfinding signs to teach your students about scale and space?

The dirt pile, apparently there for a while, adds to the constriction.","lng":-79.4028926,"lat":43.6655744},{"title":"obstructed jog","description":"Here, the sidewalk makes a sharp jog beside a parking lay-by, and pedestrians naturally walk in a more direct line through the jog, resulting in a zone of overlapping paths and potential conflicts.\u00a0 To remedy this design flaw, the sign post should be moved slightly over, the tree should be removed (it's small and there are numerous larger trees nearby), and the uneven, weedy pavers should be replaced with smooth concrete along the desire path on the right, and on the left side, the sidewalk should be expanded slightly onto the grass along that desire line.","lng":-79.4026995,"lat":43.6650893},{"title":"obstructing hydrant","description":"The sidewalk bulb-out is used effectively by the pole, broken garbage bin and poster board, but unfortunately, the hydrant didn't take advantage of that space too.\u00a0 Instead it was installed in the middle of the sidewalk, forcing pedestrians to detour around it or suffer painful injuries if they happen to walk into it.","lng":-79.4025922,"lat":43.6647633},{"title":"constricting overgrowth","description":"Of course, we all love trees and vegetation, but sometimes there can be too much of a good thing.\u00a0 In this area, a street tree is planted where there is really not enough space.\u00a0 The sidewalk is obviously too narrow.\u00a0 The tree is also allowed to grow too wide at its base, further constricting the sidewalk.\u00a0 The overgrown vegetation on both sides of the sidewalk pose a potential safety hazard as it blocks the pedestrian's view of what\/who may be behind there.","lng":-79.4025654,"lat":43.6646353},{"title":"narrow sidewalk, compacted soil","description":"The compacted soil from pedestrian traffic on either side of this very narrow sidewalk shows how much wider the sidewalk should be.\u00a0 Farther south, at the top of the photo, yard fences constrict the walking space even more.\u00a0 The uncovered tree pits allow the soil in them to be compacted, reducing the life expectancy of those trees.\u00a0 When this area is wet, it's a muddy mess.\u00a0 At least the bike rings are installed out of the way.\u00a0 But if bikes were locked there, they would constrict the sidewalk a bit.","lng":-79.4024205,"lat":43.6642938},{"title":"meter obstructing jog","description":"At this sidewalk jog around a parking lay-by, a sign and a parking meter obstruct the desire path.\u00a0 The sign and meter should both be moved as indicated by the arrows.\u00a0 Part of the reason they are installed where they are is that the edge of the sidewalk is paved with pavers which make it\u00a0 difficult to install meters and posts there.\u00a0 Perhaps the use of pavers should be rethought in areas like this.\u00a0 It would be better to have smooth concrete for better walkability and for more flexibility for infrastructure installation.","lng":-79.4022113,"lat":43.6637544},{"title":"sidewalk tree","description":"Inexplicably, this lone tree was planted in the middle of the sidewalk, even though it is in the shade of much larger trees on either side.\u00a0 As pedestrians walk around the tree, they compact the exposed soil, and this little tree is unlikely to survive there much longer and should probably be removed.\u00a0 (Again, we all love trees, but they should be planted in appropriate places.\u00a0 We would not accept a similar obstruction in the middle of a lane of vehicular traffic.)","lng":-79.402045,"lat":43.6633469},{"title":"bulb-out mini-park","description":"At this small space created by a sidewalk bulb-out, the presence of some seating (provided by the restaurants), placemarking (the Harbord sign), and just the extra sidewalk space cleared up by placing the usual infrastructure in the bulb-out creates what is in effect a mini park, where pedestrians can feel free to stop, chat, eat a snack, and socialize.","lng":-79.4023025,"lat":43.6631024},{"title":"obstructed jog","description":"At this jog around a parking lay-by, the pole adds to the disruption of pedestrian flow.\u00a0 Southbound pedestrians (walking towards the bottom of the photo) take a direct short-cut through the dirt path then continue in a straight line.\u00a0 Northbound pedestrians (walking towards the top of the photo) have to detour around the pole and go in the path of southbound walkers, creating a zone of potential conflict (the area of overlapping cross-hatching).\u00a0 The sidewalk should instead have continued on straight north (to the top of the photo), and the grass boulevard and bike parking could have been installed beside the curb.","lng":-79.4026726,"lat":43.6641075},{"title":"misaligned sidewalk","description":"The desire path in the grass shows that pedestrians would like to continue in line with the sidewalk to the north.\u00a0 Along this section, the sidewalk should have been installed adjacent to the fence (as it is further south, behind the camera), and a grassed and treed boulevard should have been created adjacent to the street here where there is no parking and therefore no need for a hard surface adjacent to the street.\u00a0 If there was a true boulevard there, perhaps a tree planted there might have a better chance of survival.","lng":-79.4028121,"lat":43.6644917},{"title":"sidewalk bulb-out","description":"The sidewalk bulb-out is used effectively here for the installation of infrastructure, creating a clear pedestrian clearway.","lng":-79.4029194,"lat":43.6646702},{"title":"obstructing hydrant","description":"For some reason, it seemed acceptable to install a fire hydrant in the middle of the sidewalk here.\u00a0 Note, also the bike stands, which could have been installed parallel rather than perpendicular to the sidewalk, freeing up some pedestrian space.\u00a0 The dilapidated, over-height newspaper box and tree stump in a weedy pit further blight this unfortunately common look.","lng":-79.4032627,"lat":43.6655317},{"title":"A-frame signs","description":"The A-frame signs in this picture could be examples of legally permitted signs (if they had a permit sticker attached).\u00a0 They are within the size limits and placed next to the building and out of the way of pedestrian flow.\u00a0 But, most A-frames in this city are illegal.\u00a0 Very few businesses bother to buy a permit and attach the sticker to their signs, and their signs are usually too big and obstructive.\u00a0 And on Yonge, south of\u00a0 Davenport, and on Bloor between Avenue and Sherbourne, all A-frame signs are outright prohibited - but it certainly doesn't look that way because the bylaw is rarely enforced.\u00a0 The bylaw is at http:\/\/www.toronto.ca\/legdocs\/municode\/1184_693.pdf and the section on A-frames is on pages 22-27.","lng":-79.4033808,"lat":43.6657645},{"title":"ample corner space","description":"At this corner, the building is suitably set back from the corner, creating ample space for pedestrians to stop and chat, and maybe read the historical plaque beside the building.\u00a0 But too often, planners underestimate how much space pedestrians need.\u00a0 They forget that pedestrians often carry bags, luggage or bundle buggies, and like to stop and chat on the sidewalk, rather than march like soldiers in single file at a uniform pace in their \"assigned\" walking lanes.","lng":-79.4038099,"lat":43.6665096},{"title":"corner space","description":"At this corner, the older building has less ample space at the corner, but at least there is a corner cut-out which opens sight lines (preventing pedestrian collisions), and provides a small bit of extra space for people to walk by others waiting to cross the street.\u00a0 Hopefully the rough sidewalk patching will be repaired soon.","lng":-79.4038904,"lat":43.6666881},{"title":"eyesore","description":"This ugly mess is at the approach to the subway stop.\u00a0 The sign is over-scaled for pedestrians, and the tagged base creates the impression that the area is neglected.\u00a0 The tagged fence, weeds, and junky newspaper boxes reinforce that impression.","lng":-79.4040138,"lat":43.667049},{"title":"subway access obstructions","description":"At this point on the sidewalk, pedestrians going to the subway station would like to cut across diagonally to the doors, but the newspaper boxes and garbage bin block that minor shortcut.\u00a0 The clutter should be installed out of the way, further in from the sidewalk.\u00a0 Note, also, the newspaper boxes and bikes which constrict the sidewalk access to the north (top of photo).\u00a0 Those, too, could be better located farther in.","lng":-79.4040728,"lat":43.667177},{"title":"parking meter","description":"Like most pay-and-display parking meters in this city, it is installed at a 45 degree angle to the sidewalk, taking up more sidewalk space than necessary.\u00a0 It has nothing to to with orienting the solar panel to the sun.\u00a0 The panel in this case is actually oriented to the north.\u00a0 It would be great if\u00a0 the city could find a version of the meter that could be attached to any of the multitude of utility poles that dot the sidewalks, rather than clutter the pedestrian space with yet another piece of stand-alone infrastructure.","lng":-79.4045448,"lat":43.6682131},{"title":"off-sidewalk installations","description":"This is a good example of installation of infrastructure (traffic control box and fire hydrant) off the sidewalk and out of pedestrians' way.\u00a0 Note the aesthetic design of the fire hydrant (the square concrete pillar at the corner).\u00a0 But why do those traffic control boxes have to be so huge and consequently, such obvious targets for tagging?","lng":-79.4047862,"lat":43.6689038},{"title":"obstructing parking meter","description":"This is another example of a parking meter installed at a 45 degree angle, which takes up more sidewalk space than if it had been installed parallel to the sidewalk, in which case there could likely be room for another pedestrian to pass by here.\u00a0 The angle also exposes another surface to tagging and graffiti.","lng":-79.404459,"lat":43.6684187},{"title":"barren streetscape","description":"The barren landscaping along this wide parking lot frontage creates an unwelcoming environment for pedestrians - it's clearly a zone designed for cars more than for people.\u00a0 Some trees and seating between the sidewalk and the parking lot are needed.\u00a0 The sidewalk should be widened too (there is room to do so) The worn-out path in the grass is evidence that the sidewalk is too narrow.","lng":-79.4043303,"lat":43.6679919},{"title":"newspaper boxes","description":"This long row of poorly-maintained newspaper boxes constricts a very busy part of the sidewalk outside the subway station.\u00a0 Slowly, haphazard collections of newspaper boxes, such as this one, are being replaced with more compact multi-boxes as part of the street furniture program.\u00a0 When that happens at this location, let's hope the new multi-box is installed out of the pedestrian flow zone.\u00a0 The garbage can adds to constriction, as no one would want to walk too close to it and risk brushing against some of the grime that usually is found along the rims of those bins.","lng":-79.4040969,"lat":43.6673943},{"title":"fragmented sidewalk","description":"The row of trees and bikes fragments the sidewalk, resulting in two narrow paths, both wide enough for only two single lanes of pedestrian traffic.\u00a0 The path beside the street is slightly constricted by the newspaper box, and at the south end, there are other obstructions.\u00a0 The vehicle which is parked too far out obstructs the other path.","lng":-79.4039628,"lat":43.6670975},{"title":"typical pedestrians","description":"This picture is a great illustration of what planners should consider when designing pedestrian space: - pedestrians do not just march in an orderly single file with nothing else that takes up more space.\u00a0 They typically carry something (luggage, parcels, gym bags, food, etc) and often like to stop in the sidewalk to chat or read a map.\u00a0 Others might be in a hurry and like to have more space to rush by.\u00a0 The city standard minimum pedestrian clearway width of 2.1 metres is inadequate in real-world usage.\u00a0 Here the space is too tight and cluttered, forcing people to constantly be aware of obstructions, or perhaps obstructing traffic themselves.","lng":-79.403834,"lat":43.6668084},{"title":"through the utility pole forest","description":"This corner is far too typical - numerous utility poles are installed without consideration given to the impact on pedestrian flow.\u00a0 Here, there is just enough room for one typical pedestrian (carrying bags) to weave through the

After the walk, attendees are encouraged to stay to mingle and discuss their own ideas for walks.<\/p>\n\n <p>In the December 1972 election, the composition of Toronto City Council radically changed.

From banana flowers and injera to giant catfish and dozens of herbs and spices you've never heard of, the bustling and emphatically un-gentrified eastern reaches of the Danforth present a cornucopia of culturally-specific fare that can pass unnoticed by residents en-route to the big-chain supermarket.   Participants will be introduced to some of the lesser-known food products and culinary ingredients available at local fruit markets, bakeries, butchers, fish markets and grocers, and invited to broaden our palates by incorporating them in our own household cuisines.  Along the way, we'll be invited to broaden our thinking on just what ingredients make for a healthy and desirable neighborhood. \n\n\"The posted walk for 2pm, May 1st, is an Open Dress Rehearsal.

Using Riverdale and Leslieville\u2019s streets as examples, we will walk through and talk about different types of streets, how we prioritize uses, and where Toronto\u2019s street design is headed.\n\nThis walk is for anyone who wants to know more about how the City makes decisions about it streets, and to understand more about how to think about them as complete or incomplete.\n\nThe walk will start at Danforth and Pape, meander down through Riverdale, and end in the heart of Leslieville, on Queen Street.","accessibleInfo":"We will be walking from the Danforth down to Queen, so it's a fairly gentle slope.

There, actors Esther Arbeid and Bella Larsen will perform a short dramatization of one of Helen's most moving stories.\n\nThe walk is approximately 12 city blocks and begins at 2 pm at 599 College Street (southwest corner of Clinton, kiddy corner to Cafe Diplomatico). It will continue east and eventually end up at 187 Brunswick Avenue, which is a few doors north of Harbord. Walk leaders are Dave Carley (who has dramatized Helen's work for stage), Jim Polk (who is editing her fiction for publication) and Helen's sons - Daniel and Paul.\n\nThe walk is along city sidewalks - mostly College Street and Brunswick Avenue. There are a few steps into the synagogue.

We travel along the north side of Lake Shore to Fifth Street, passing the old Goodyear Plant along the way. From there we travel north to Birmingham St., stopping at the old Town Hall and at the Campbell Soup plant. From there we travel east to Dwight Ave, and then west along Birmingham to Kipling, after which we travel south to arrive back at The Assembly Hall. The early development of New Toronto, as Jane Fairburn notes in Along the Shore (2013), got a tremendous boost with the arrival\u00a0of railway service in the late 1800s. Beginning on July 1, 1895, a radial railway ran from Toronto all the way to Etobicoke Creek. As a reliable and cheap form of transportation, the radial railway enabled working and middle-class people to find their way to Mimico, New Toronto, and Long Branch.\u00a0What has happened in the years that followed?  We can speak of a postwar era of industrial productivity and prosperity. Then came a period of deindustrialization and the attendant challenges. Now things are changing once again.

We begin at the Starbucks at 5251 Dundas St. West (on the south side of Dundas) near the Kipling subway station. We travel east on Dundas, stopping for a view of the construction site. We traverse the site of the old Westwood Theatre, note the location of the new entrance to the Kipling subway station, and then travel west to Six Points Park which will nearly double in size once the interchange reconfiguration is completed. In the 1960s the former Metro Toronto conceived and built the interchange to speed traffic through the awkward intersection of Kipling, Dundas, and Bloor (Six Points). Then a suburban site at the edge of the city the interchange was to assist with traffic flow from the industrial areas to the south onward to Highway 427 in the west. In the 1980s the former City of Etobicoke identified this area as its future City Centre, an unrealizable dream due in part to the design of the road network. As a City of Toronto Councillor, Peter Milczyn led the planning and redesign for the City Centre area as well as changes resulting in the Six Points Reconfiguration project. The scale and transformative nature of the plans for the area have been noticed internationally as an example of urban renewal.

Despite currently being frozen in its 1812 state, the site of Fort York has assumed a host of other identities across both human and geologic time. From keeper of underground saltwater and mysterious expanding bedrock, to stopover point for migratory birds, to grounds of thriving livestock industry, the site of Fort York is full of surprises. \n\nJoin us as we share seven 'offline' tales from this unusual place: alternate histories from its past, present and future. How can the pre- and post-1812 stories of Fort York change the way that we think about this site preserved in time? As rapid transformation and development take place along the site's edges, how can digging deep into the Fort's history give us new ideas for the future?\n\nTrained as architects and landscape architects, the walk will be led by Nicolas Koff, Marisa Bernstein (both Projexity) and Ya'el Santopinto (Gauge Design), with contributions by Rui Felix, Kaari Kitawi, Tayler Bishop and Grace Yang (University of Toronto Master of Landscape Architecture candidates whose Fall 2014 design studio, taught by Nicolas, centered around Fort York).

But the nightwalker is also on a hunt for the sublime, radically present, open to experience and curious about the places that scare them.                                                    <i>Nightwalking is a meditation. <\/i><\/p>                                                                                                 \n\n<p>In my own nightwalking along every street, alley, park and vacant lot in radius, I gradually discovered 42 hidden pedestrian staircases in my Toronto neighbourhood.  This chutes-and-ladders wandering became a project to document each staircase with detailed illustrations and field notes, creating a psychogeographic guidebook for nightwalkers: <i>A Catalogue of Nocturnal Staircases. <\/i><\/p>\n\n<p>This late-night Jane\u2019s Walk will be an introduction to the roving meditation of nightwalking, exploring these secluded pedestrian staircases. Participants will be lead in a shared experience of darkness, silence, solitude and transgression. Punctuating periods of silent nightwalking will be opportunities for shared discussion of questions raised by this action: experiences of wonder, issues of gender and identity, tensions of public vs. private space, encounters with fear.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please note the following: \n\n<p>\u2022 This walk will cover uneven ground in darkness. Please wear sturdy shoes and participate at your own risk.\n\n<p>\u2022 To allow for a depth of experience, and to respect our neighbours, please be prepared to spend much of this late night walk in silence.<\/p>\n<p> See Friday's  <a href=\"http:\/\/janeswalk.org\/canada\/toronto\/nightwalking-secret-staircases-1\/\">Nightwalking & Secret Staircases #1 Swansea<\/a><\/p>","accessibleInfo":"This walk will cover uneven ground in darkness.

However, Jane Jacobs stressed that many city parks are deprived places that need the boon of life and appreciation to thrive. She further suggested that the success of parks should be determined by what we give to parks instead of what parks give to us. Parks that are 'taken care of' with varied uses around them should be more lively and populated. In contrast, parks that are not nurtured and promoted as diverse places can become undesirable and regarded as unsafe. How do these ideas apply to Toronto parks? What makes a great park in Toronto? We will ponder Jacob's ideas as we explore Etienne Brule Park and King's Mill Park - two parks that serve the Old Mill area yet differ in many ways. As we walk the park trails, we will evaluate the parks in terms of what they offer to the community and in turn what can be offered to the parks to make them lively 'community connectors.'

Acknowledging current planning processes, the walk will also be interactive, eliciting a conversation about the future of the neighbourhood.\n","accessibleInfo":null,"accessibleTransit":null,"accessibleParking":null,"accessibleFind":"Simon and Antonio will be holding a sign and waiting in the parking lot just west of the old Backpacker's Hostel building.","map":{"markers":[{"lat":43.645483233317,"lng":-79.395526484782,"title":"Meeting Place: Parking lot west of Old backpackers Hostel, Spadina and King","description":"Parking lot west of Old backpackers Hostel, Spadina and King","media":null,"style":"stop"},{"lat":43.645467706025,"lng":-79.396235929067,"title":"","description":"","media":null,"style":"stop"},{"lat":43.645909975825,"lng":-79.397170678908,"title":"Mid-block courtyard","description":"","media":null,"style":"stop"},{"lat":43.645186730671,"lng":-79.397350386912,"title":"Allied Properties","description":"","media":null,"style":"stop"},{"lat":43.64448145825,"lng":-79.396298960978,"title":"Mid-block connection","description":"","media":null,"style":"stop"},{"lat":43.644725302662,"lng":-79.398324028785,"title":"","description":"","media":null,"style":"stop"},{"lat":43.643752684891,"lng":-79.399826065833,"title":"Stewart\/Portland","description":"","media":null,"style":"stop"},{"lat":43.64266359134,"lng":-79.400019184882,"title":"Victoria Memorial Park","description":"","media":null,"style":"stop"}],"route":[{"lat":43.64548129015,"lng":-79.395526349517},{"lat":43.645859766679,"lng":-79.395649731132},{"lat":43.645919934522,"lng":-79.395376145812},{"lat":43.645483231061,"lng":-79.395204484435},{"lat":43.645302726036,"lng":-79.396137893173},{"lat":43.64565209005,"lng":-79.396336376558},{"lat":43.645562808313,"lng":-79.396749436746},{"lat":43.645939343492,"lng":-79.397033750902},{"lat":43.645881116566,"lng":-79.397296607385},{"lat":43.645518167455,"lng":-79.397264420877},{"lat":43.645105722622,"lng":-79.397106170545},{"lat":43.64507830707,"lng":-79.397244974862},{"lat":43.645202283489,"lng":-79.39735159267},{"lat":43.645054530741,"lng":-79.397313371191},{"lat":43.645007705903,"lng":-79.397532641778},{"lat":43.64489901391,"lng":-79.397505819688},{"lat":43.645085342921,"lng":-79.396534860025},{"lat":43.644409897448,"lng":-79.396277368041},{"lat":43.644252680616,"lng":-79.396207630607},{"lat":43.644343905247,"lng":-79.395821392509},{"lat":43.64477091232,"lng":-79.395952820751},{"lat":43.644821376592,"lng":-79.396105706665},{"lat":43.64514175903,"lng":-79.396221488701},{"lat":43.644965134835,"lng":-79.3972031772},{"lat":43.644724459272,"lng":-79.398324340527},{"lat":43.644393593496,"lng":-79.39994193619},{"lat":43.644092746045,"lng":-79.399835988934},{"lat":43.643779280792,"lng":-79.399712607319},{"lat":43.643749195805,"lng":-79.399817213471},{"lat":43.643223191349,"lng":-79.399609342272},{"lat":43.643201840518,"lng":-79.399616047795},{"lat":43.643038239506,"lng":-79.399640187676},{"lat":43.642882402032,"lng":-79.399717971737},{"lat":43.642765384148,"lng":-79.399838671143},{"lat":43.642663894058,"lng":-79.400013014729}]},"team":[{"type":"you","name-first":"Simon","name-last":"Ko","role":"walk-leader","primary":"on","bio":"Simon Ko - Architect and Principal, DIALOG","twitter":"DIALOGToronto","facebook":null,"website":"www.dialogdesign.ca","email":"sko@dialogdesign.ca","phone":"416.623.1080"},{"type":"leader","name-first":"Antonio","name-last":"G\u00f3mez-Palacio","bio":"Antonio G\u00f3mez-Palacio - Planner, Architect, and Principal, DIALOG","primary":"","twitter":"aurbanist","facebook":"","website":"www.dialogdesign.ca","email":"agp@dialogdesign.ca","phone":"416.849.6832"},{"type":"organizer","name-first":"DIALOG","name-last":"","institution":"","website":"www.dialogdesign.ca","phone":""}],"time":{"open":false,"type":null,"slots":[["1430661600","1430667000"]]},"wards":null,"initiatives":[],"mirrors":{"eventbrite":null},"thumbnails":[{"id":"4659","url":"\/files\/cache\/bec4acf3745b23fba6c8e94b17a696a4_f4659.jpg"}],"thumbnailId":"4659","thumbnailUrl":"\/files\/cache\/bec4acf3745b23fba6c8e94b17a696a4_f4659.jpg","checkboxes":{"theme-urban-architecturalenthusiast":true,"theme-culture-aesthete":true,"theme-civic-goodneighbour":true,"accessible-familyfriendly":true,"accessible-wheelchair":true,"accessible-dogs":true,"accessible-strollers":true,"accessible-bicycles":true}},{"id":"6582","title":"Hot City: see what is literally hot and cool in Toronto","url":"http:\/\/janeswalk.org\/canada\/toronto\/hot-city-see-what-literally-hot-and-cool-toronto\/","shortDescription":"From the depths of our cold winter, to the height of our hot summers \u2013 how do buildings cope with the heat indoors and outdoors?","longDescription":"*PLEASE NOTE NEW TIME - Due to forecasted inclement weather, this walk will now be on WEDNESDAY 6 May 2015 at 7pm.

In order to provide this much needed open space, the City often negotiates with private developers to provide land for public spaces, or to include Privately Owned Publicly-Accessible Open Space (POPS) as part of their developments. Often these developments also contribute public art through the City's \"Percent for Public Art Program\" to animate these open spaces. Since the year 2000, through the development review process, at least 1 million square feet of open space have been added to Toronto's downtown alone.\n\nThis walking tour will showcase a variety of these open spaces and the award-winning public art pieces that accentuate them.  This is also the \"sequel\" to a popular Jane's Walk offered the previous year, but no previous attendance is required.  Join us to discover new open spaces that were unknown to you and to discuss ways to increase public awareness of these city amenities.\n","accessibleInfo":"Some street crossings might be challenging for a big group.

Exploring Heritage Character in Toronto's Downtown.","url":"http:\/\/janeswalk.org\/canada\/toronto\/demolish-or-not-demolish-exploring-heritage-character-torontos-downtown\/","shortDescription":"This walk explores the layered nature of Toronto's urban development since 1800, and the social and economic forces that have shaped it.","longDescription":"Ever wonder what 'heritage character' means, or what it means to label a building as a 'heritage building'? How do you determine a neighbourhood, or building, has heritage character? Does it just need to be old? Or designed by a famous architect? \n\nDefining the \u201cheritage character\u201d of a building, or a neighbourhood, is a challenge that conservationists constantly grapple with. In a city like Toronto, this challenge is compounded by the fact that many of the city\u2019s early neighbourhoods have been more-or-less constantly changing since they were built. Thus, what is special and unique about these neighbourhoods is not easily described by the age of buildings, their architectural style, shape, or height. \n\nThis walk proposes to explore the idea of heritage character by borrowing the concept of stratigraphy from Geology and applying it to the city. Stratigraphy is the study of strata, or layers, of the earth's surface that have accumulated over time. Understanding the process of stratification, or the means by which these layers accumulate, allows geologists to understand the history of the earth, and the principal events that have shaped it.  \n\nWe will apply this idea to one of Toronto\u2019s early neighbourhoods\u2014Historic Yonge Street\u2014by analyzing its built form as a series of layers. These layers, or strata, have accumulated in unexpected ways, and studying their relation to each other helps us understand the character of the neighbourhood, and of the economic and social forces that have shaped it. \n\nParticipants will enjoy a guided tour of key sites that illustrate the complex and layered character of the neighbourhood, while participating in an observation-based discussion of how development has become layered beside buildings, beneath buildings, on top of buildings, and within buildings.\n","accessibleInfo":"Entirely urban area, we pass along mainly back lanes, some park paths, all of which are paved.
